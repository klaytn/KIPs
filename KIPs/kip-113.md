## Simple Summary

A design of simple BLS12-381 registry.

## Abstract

This standard defines an interface for BLS12-381 registry, which enables nodes or smart contracts to access and view all the public keys of GCs. This is not to replace AddressBook, but rather to supplement it in order to facilitate the use of BLS in various components, including signature-based random (KIP-114).

## Motivation

The current design of AddressBook cannot incorporate BLS12-381 keys. The lack of BLS registry limits the use of BLS from the node. The objective is to design a simple registry that includes essential functions, and minimal access control, thereby reducing any potential security risks.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Registry contract must implement the IKIP_113 interface:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

/// @title KIP-113 BLS public key registry
/// @dev See https://github.com/klaytn/kips/issues/113
interface IKIP_113 {
    struct BlsPublicKeyInfo {
        /// @dev compressed BLS12-381 public key (48 bytes)
        bytes publicKey;

        /// @dev proof-of-possession (96 bytes)
        ///  must be a result of PopProve algorithm as per
        ///  draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-05 section 3.3.3.
        ///  with ciphersuite "BLS_SIG_BLS12381G2_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_POP_"
        bytes pop;
    }

    event PubkeyRegistered(address cnNodeId, bytes publicKey, bytes pop);
    event PubkeyUnegistered(address cnNodeId, bytes publicKey, bytes pop);

    /// @dev Registers the given public key associated with the `msg.sender` address.
    ///  The function validates the following requirements:
    ///  - The function MUST revert if `publicKey.length != 48` or `pop.length != 96`
    ///  - The function MUST revert if `publicKey` or `pop` is equal to zero
    ///  - The function SHOULD authenticate and authorize `msg.sender` (implementations can vary across chains; for Cypress, see [here](https://kips.klaytn.foundation/KIPs/kip-113#cypress-specific-implementation))
    ///  The function emits a `PubkeyRegistered` event.
    ///  _Note_ The function is not able to verify the validity of the public key and the proof-of-possession due to the lack of [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537). See [validation](https://kips.klaytn.foundation/KIPs/kip-113#validation) for off-chain validation.
    function registerPublicKey(bytes memory publicKey, bytes memory pop) external;

    /// @dev Unregisters the public key associated with the given `cnNodeId` address.
    ///  The function validates the following requirements:
    ///  - The function MUST revert if `cnNodeId` has not been registered
    ///  - The function SHOULD authenticate and authorize `msg.sender`
    ///  The function emits a `PubkeyUnregistered` event.
    function unregisterPublicKey(address cnNodeId) external;

    /// @dev Returns the public key and proof-of-possession given a `cnNodeId`.
    ///  The function MUST revert if given `cnNodeId` is not registered.
    ///  _Note_ The function is not able to verify the validity of the public key and the proof-of-possession due to the lack of [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537). See [validation](https://kips.klaytn.foundation/KIPs/kip-113#validation) for off-chain validation.
    function getInfo(address cnNodeId) external view returns (BlsPublicKeyInfo pubkey);

    /// @dev Returns all the stored node IDs, public keys, and proof-of-possessions at once.
    ///  _Note_ The function is not able to verify the validity of the public key and the proof-of-possession due to the lack of [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537). See [validation](https://kips.klaytn.foundation/KIPs/kip-113#validation) for off-chain validation.
    function getAllInfo() external view returns (address[] memory nodeIdList, BlsPublicKeyInfo[] memory pubkeyList);
}
```

### Definitions

- Public key: BLS12-381 key under [minimal-pubkey-size](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-05.html#section-2.1-2.2.2) configuration (48 bytes)
- Proof-of-possession (pop): the signature of the hash of the public key (96 bytes)

### Smart Contracts Overview

The proposed smart contract will be implemented in Solidity and will be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

The smart contract will have the following features:

- Register a public key and a proof-of-possession
- Unregister a public key
- View the registered public keys

#### Methods

##### registerPublicKey

Registers the given public key associated with the `msg.sender` address.

The function validates the following requirements:

- The function MUST revert if `publicKey.length != 48` or `pop.length != 96`
- The function MUST revert if `publicKey` or `pop` is equal to zero
- The function SHOULD authenticate and authorize `msg.sender` (implementations can vary across chains; for Cypress, see [here](#cypress-specific-implementation))

The function emits a `PubkeyRegistered` event.

_Note_ The function is not able to verify the validity of the public key and the proof-of-possession due to the lack of [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537). See [validation](#validation) for off-chain validation.

```solidity
function registerPublicKey(bytes memory publicKey, bytes memory pop)
```

##### unregisterPublicKey

Unregisters the public key associated with the given `cnNodeId` address.

The function validates the following requirements:

- The function MUST revert if `cnNodeId` has not been registered
- The function SHOULD authenticate and authorize `msg.sender`

The function emits a `PubkeyUnregistered` event.

```solidity
function unregisterPublicKey(address cnNodeId)
```

##### getInfo

Returns the public key and proof-of-possession given a `cnNodeId`.

The function MUST revert if given `cnNodeId` is not registered.

_Note_ The function is not able to verify the validity of the public key and the proof-of-possession due to the lack of [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537). See [validation](#validation) for off-chain validation.

```solidity
function getInfo(address cnNodeId) external view returns (BlsPublicKeyInfo pubkey)
```

##### getAllInfo

Returns all the stored node IDs, public keys, and proof-of-possessions at once.

_Note_ The function is not able to verify the validity of the public key and the proof-of-possession due to the lack of [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537). See [validation](#validation) for off-chain validation.

```solidity
function getAllInfo() external view returns (address[] nodeId, BlsPublicKeyInfo[])
```

### Core Logic Overview

The target block number must be specified per chain in ChainConfig; starting from the target block number, the node shall read the contract and use its data. Before the target block number, the contract should be ready to use, meaning that deploying Registry contract and registering the public keys should be done.

#### Chain Configuration

In the ChainConfig, the following fields are introduced. All node operators in a network must update `genesis.json` configuration with the same value. The configuration values for Baobab and Cypress networks are hard-coded on the client source code.

- kip113CompatibleBlock: the block number which a Klaytn node starts using Registry.
- kip113ContractAddress: the address of a contract that implements IKIP_113.

#### Validation

After reading from Registry, the node must perform the following validations:

- [KeyValidate](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-05.html#section-2.5)
- [PopVerify](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-05.html#section-3.3.3)

## Rationale

### Design decisions

#### Registry is not upgradeable

The upgradeable proxy pattern allows the functionality of contracts to be upgraded without changing their addresses.
However, Registry should not be implemented via upgradeable proxy contract due to its impact on the ecosystem:

- Upgrade can be done covertly by the contract owner
- Upgrade can happen at an arbitrary block
- Upgrade key can be stolen

In other words, should Registry be upgraded, Registry must be redeployed to have a different address.

#### Propagating the Registry address via ChainConfig

There are several methods to propagate the a system contract address to the network:

1. HeaderGov: deploy the contract from EOA, and make a governance vote from the governing node (the method used for Baobab GovParam address)
2. ContractGov: deploy the contract from EOA, and make an on-chain governance vote
3. SpareContract: deploy the contract from EOA, and set the address to `AddressBook.spareContract`
4. ChainConfig: deploy the contract from EOA, and set the address to ChainConfig (the method used for TreasuryRebalance, a.k.a. [KIP-103](https://kips.klaytn.foundation/KIPs/kip-103))
5. Precompiled-contract: deploy the contract from EOA, and introduce a new Precompiled contract that returns its address
6. Bytecode-injection: inject a bytecode to a predefined address at hardfork

We can view each method from the following point of view:

##### Explicit contract logic upgrade

| Methods                                          | [1] HeaderGov | [2] ContractGov                        | [3] SpareContract | [4] ChainConfig | [5] Precompiled-contract | [6] Bytecode-injection |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Upgrade with hardfork                            | X             | X                                      | X                 | O               | O                        | O                      |
| Managing address change timing                   | O             | O                                      | X                 | O               | O                        | O                      |
| Awareness of user contracts after address update | X             | △<br> Latest GovParam address required | O                 | X               | O                        | X                      |

In terms of explicit contract logic upgrade, ChainConfig, Precompiled-contract, and Bytecode-injection are recommended

##### Usability from service-chain

| Methods                      | [1] HeaderGov  | [2] ContractGov           | [3] SpareContract              | [4] ChainConfig | [5] Precompiled-contract          | [6] Bytecode-injection |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Binary modification required | O              | O                         | X<br>Patch AddressBook address | O               | X<br> Patch the hardcoded address | O                      |
| Contract deployment required | X<br> Registry | X <br> Registry, GovParam | X <br> Registry, AddressBook   | X<br> Registry  | X<br> Registry                    | X<br> AddressBook      |

In terms of usability from service-chain, HeaderGov, ContractGov, ChainConfig, and Bytecode-injection are recommended

##### Others

| Methods                                            | [1] HeaderGov                 | [2] ContractGov               | [3] SpareContract             | [4] ChainConfig      | [5] Precompiled-contract | [6] Bytecode-injection |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Immediate panic at hardfork from out-of-date nodes | △<br> At GovernanceData block | X<br> At the activation block | △<br> At SpareContract update | O                    | O                        | O                      |
| Registry initial data setup before hardfork        | O                             | O                             | O                             | O                    | O                        | X                      |
| Special address (like 0x0…400)                     | X<br> vanity address          | X<br> vanity address          | X<br> vanity address          | X<br> vanity address | O                        | O                      |

In terms of usability from ChainConfig, Precompiled-contract, and Bytecode-injection are recommended

Overall, we choose ChainConfig because

- users are mainly Klaytn nodes, not contracts so the awareness of user contracts after address update is less important
- ease of use in service chain
- initial data setup before hardfork is viable
- special address format is less important

## Backwards Compatibility

This does not affect the backward compatibility as this is a newly deployed contract.

## Implementation

A reference implementation: [TODO: github link]

### Cypress-specific implementation

Cypress has the following access controls:

- `registerPublicKey` reverts if `msg.sender` is not a `cnNodeId` from AddressBook
- `unregisterPublicKey` reverts if `msg.sender` is not an admin from AddressBook
