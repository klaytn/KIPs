## Simple Summary

A design of simple BLS12-381 registry.

## Abstract

This standard defines an interface for BLS12-381 registry, which enables nodes or smart contracts to access and view all the public keys of the associated addresses.

## Motivation

A standard interface allows developers to associate an address with a BLS public key, and provides a standardized way of interacting with the registry. The objective is to design a simple registry that includes essential functions, and minimal access control, thereby reducing any potential security risks.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Registry contract must implement the IKIP113 interface:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

/// @title KIP-113 BLS public key registry
/// @dev See https://github.com/klaytn/kips/issues/113
interface IKIP113 {
    struct BlsPublicKeyInfo {
        /// @dev compressed BLS12-381 public key (48 bytes)
        bytes publicKey;
        /// @dev proof-of-possession (96 bytes)
        ///  must be a result of PopProve algorithm as per
        ///  draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-05 section 3.3.3.
        ///  with ciphersuite "BLS_SIG_BLS12381G2_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_POP_"
        bytes pop;
    }
    event PubkeyRegistered(address cnNodeId, bytes publicKey, bytes pop);
    event PubkeyUnregistered(address cnNodeId, bytes publicKey, bytes pop);

    /// @dev Registers the given public key associated with the `msg.sender` address.
    ///  The function validates the following requirements:
    ///  - The function MUST revert if `publicKey.length != 48` or `pop.length != 96`
    ///  - The function MUST revert if `publicKey` or `pop` is equal to zero
    ///  - The function SHOULD authenticate and authorize `msg.sender` (implementations can vary across chains; for Cypress, see [here](https://kips.klaytn.foundation/KIPs/kip-113#cypress-specific-implementation))
    ///  The function emits a `PubkeyRegistered` event.
    ///  _Note_ The function is not able to verify the validity of the public key and the proof-of-possession due to the lack of [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537). See [validation](https://kips.klaytn.foundation/KIPs/kip-113#validation) for off-chain validation.
    function registerPublicKey(bytes calldata publicKey, bytes calldata pop) external;

    /// @dev Unregisters the public key associated with the given `cnNodeId` address.
    ///  The function validates the following requirements:
    ///  - The function MUST revert if `cnNodeId` has not been registered
    ///  - The function SHOULD authenticate and authorize `msg.sender`
    ///  The function emits a `PubkeyUnregistered` event.
    function unregisterPublicKey(address cnNodeId) external;

    /// @dev Returns the public key and proof-of-possession given a `cnNodeId`.
    ///  The function MUST revert if given `cnNodeId` is not registered.
    ///  _Note_ The function is not able to verify the validity of the public key and the proof-of-possession due to the lack of [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537). See [validation](https://kips.klaytn.foundation/KIPs/kip-113#validation) for off-chain validation.
    function getInfo(address cnNodeId) external view returns (BlsPublicKeyInfo memory pubkey);

    /// @dev Returns all the stored node IDs, public keys, and proof-of-possessions at once.
    ///  _Note_ The function is not able to verify the validity of the public key and the proof-of-possession due to the lack of [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537). See [validation](https://kips.klaytn.foundation/KIPs/kip-113#validation) for off-chain validation.
    function getAllInfo() external view returns (address[] memory nodeIdList, BlsPublicKeyInfo[] memory pubkeyList);
}
```

### Parameters

| Constant                  | Value |
| ------------------------- | ----- |
| `FORK_BLOCK`              | TBD   |
| `KIP113_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` | TBD   |

### Definitions

The terms public key and proof-of-possession (hereinafter referred to as pop) are from the ciphersuite [BLS_SIG_BLS12381G2_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_POP\_](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-05.html#section-4.2.3). Things to note:

- Public key: 48 bytes.
- Proof-of-possession (pop): 96 bytes.

### Smart Contracts Overview

The proposed smart contract will be implemented in Solidity and will be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

The smart contract will have the following features:

- Register a public key and a proof-of-possession
- Unregister a public key
- View the registered public keys

#### Methods

##### registerPublicKey

Registers the given public key associated with the `msg.sender` address. This function can be called whether `msg.sender` has already registered a public key or not.

The function validates the following requirements:

- The function MUST revert if `publicKey.length != 48` or `pop.length != 96`.
- The function MUST revert if `publicKey` or `pop` is equal to zero.
- The function SHOULD authenticate and authorize `msg.sender` (implementations can vary across chains; for Cypress, see [here](#cypress-specific-implementation)).

The function emits a `PubkeyRegistered` event.

_Note_ The function is not able to verify the validity of the public key and the proof-of-possession due to the lack of [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537). See [validation](#validation) for off-chain validation.

```solidity
function registerPublicKey(bytes memory publicKey, bytes memory pop)
```

##### unregisterPublicKey

Unregisters the public key associated with the given `cnNodeId` address.

The function validates the following requirements:

- The function MUST revert if `cnNodeId` has not been registered.
- The function SHOULD authenticate and authorize `msg.sender`.

The function emits a `PubkeyUnregistered` event.

```solidity
function unregisterPublicKey(address cnNodeId)
```

##### getInfo

Returns the public key and proof-of-possession given a `cnNodeId`.

The function MUST revert if given `cnNodeId` is not registered.

_Note_ The function is not able to verify the validity of the public key and the proof-of-possession due to the lack of [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537). See [validation](#validation) for off-chain validation.

```solidity
function getInfo(address cnNodeId) external view returns (BlsPublicKeyInfo pubkey)
```

##### getAllInfo

Returns all the stored node IDs, public keys, and proof-of-possessions at once.

_Note_ The function is not able to verify the validity of the public key and the proof-of-possession due to the lack of [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537). See [validation](#validation) for off-chain validation.

```solidity
function getAllInfo() external view returns (address[] nodeId, BlsPublicKeyInfo[])
```

### Core Logic Overview

The `FORK_BLOCK` and `KIP113_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` must be specified per chain in ChainConfig; starting from `FORK_BLOCK`, the node shall read the contract that supports IKIP113 at the address `KIP113_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`. Before `FORK_BLOCK`, the contract should be ready to use, meaning that deploying Registry contract and registering the public keys should be done.

#### Validation

After reading from Registry, the node must perform the following validations:

- [KeyValidate](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-05.html#section-2.5)
- [PopVerify](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-05.html#section-3.3.3)

## Rationale

### Design decisions

#### Registry is not upgradeable

The upgradeable proxy pattern allows the functionality of contracts to be upgraded without changing their addresses.
However, Registry should not be implemented via upgradeable proxy contract due to its impact on the ecosystem:

- Upgrade can be done covertly by the contract owner.
- Upgrade can happen at an arbitrary block.
- Upgrade key can be stolen.

In other words, should Registry be upgraded, Registry must be redeployed to have a different address.

#### Propagating the Registry address via ChainConfig

There are several methods to propagate the a system contract address to the network:

1. HeaderGov: deploy the contract from EOA, and make a governance vote from the governing node (the method used for Baobab GovParam address).
2. ContractGov: deploy the contract from EOA, and make an on-chain governance vote.
3. SpareContract: deploy the contract from EOA, and set the address to `AddressBook.spareContract`.
4. ChainConfig: deploy the contract from EOA, and set the address to ChainConfig (the method used for TreasuryRebalance, a.k.a. [KIP-103](https://kips.klaytn.foundation/KIPs/kip-103)).
5. Precompiled-contract: deploy the contract from EOA, and introduce a new Precompiled contract that returns its address.
6. Bytecode-injection: inject a bytecode to a predefined address at hardfork.

We can view each method from the following point of view:

##### Explicit contract logic upgrade

| Methods                                                          | [1] HeaderGov | [2] ContractGov                        | [3] SpareContract | [4] ChainConfig | [5] Precompiled-contract | [6] Bytecode-injection |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Hardfork required when upgrade                                   | X             | X                                      | X                 | O               | O                        | O                      |
| Possible to set the target block number for address change       | O             | O                                      | X                 | O               | O                        | O                      |
| Possible to find the updated addresses from subscriber contracts | X             | △<br> Latest GovParam address required | O                 | X               | O                        | X                      |

In terms of explicit contract logic upgrade, ChainConfig, Precompiled-contract, and Bytecode-injection are recommended.

##### Usability from ServiceChain

| Methods                      | [1] HeaderGov  | [2] ContractGov           | [3] SpareContract              | [4] ChainConfig | [5] Precompiled-contract          | [6] Bytecode-injection |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |

In terms of usability from ServiceChain, HeaderGov, ContractGov, ChainConfig, and Bytecode-injection are recommended.

##### Others

| Methods                                          | [1] HeaderGov                 | [2] ContractGov               | [3] SpareContract             | [4] ChainConfig      | [5] Precompiled-contract | [6] Bytecode-injection |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Possible to panic outdated nodes at hardfork     | X<br> At GovernanceData block | X<br> At the activation block | X<br> At SpareContract update | O                    | O                        | O                      |
| Possible to setup initial data before hardfork   | O                             | O                             | O                             | O                    | O                        | X                      |
| Possible to use a special address (like 0x0…400) | X<br> vanity address          | X<br> vanity address          | X<br> vanity address          | X<br> vanity address | O                        | O                      |

In terms of various remaining aspects, ChainConfig, Precompiled-contract, and Bytecode-injection are recommended.

Overall, we choose ChainConfig because:

- The main subscriber is not smart contracts but rather the Core protocol, so the awareness of subscriber contracts after address update is less important.
- Ease of use in all of ServiceChain, Baobab (testnet), Cypress (mainnet).
- Initial data setup before hardfork is viable.
- Special address format is less important.

## Backwards Compatibility

This does not affect the backward compatibility as this is a newly deployed contract.

## Implementation

A reference implementation: [link](https://github.com/klaytn/simple-bls-registry)

### Cypress-specific implementation

Cypress has the following access controls:

- `registerPublicKey` reverts if `msg.sender` is not a `cnNodeId` registered in AddressBook.
- `unregisterPublicKey(cnNodeId)` reverts if `msg.sender` is not an admin of AddressBook, or if `cnNodeId` is in AddressBook.
