## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the KIP.-->
A dynamic gas fee pricing mechanism based on network usage, that includes fixed-per-block network fee that is partially burned.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
There is a base fee per gas in protocol, which can move up or down for each block according to a formula which is a function of the gas used in the parent block and the gas target. The algorithm results in the base fee per gas increasing when the gas used in the previous block is above the gas target, and decreasing when the gas used in the previous block is below the gas target. It repeats until base fee reaches the lower bound fee or the upper bound fee. The base fee per gas is partially burned. Transactions specify the maximum fee per gas they are willing to pay in total. The transaction will always pay the base fee per gas of the block it was included in.
 

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for KIPs that want to change the Klaytn protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the KIP solves. KIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Klaytn has been following a policy of “fixed gas price“, with the gas price fixed at a certain level (e.g. 25 ston and 750 ston). This approach was adopted in the initial phase because it allows users to easily send transactions without having to predict the gas fee, while minimizing the volatility of transaction fees. But in the periods leading up to the gas price increase, we have seen a lot of transaction bursts on Klaytn with the following problems:

* **Delay of transaction execution** : A large number of transactions were being generated at the same time, leading to increased process time for users. The fundamental cause to this was the sudden surge in transactions. But there were cases of thousands of transactions being fired to process a certain transaction. And the reason behind this repeated phenomenon was the absence of an algorithm that prioritizes Klaytn transactions as well as of an appropriate gas price policy.
* **Storage overload** : The aforementioned a large number of transactions are created mostly by bots, and are mostly reverted and useless transactions. These transactions strain the Klaytn storage in the long-term, which can hinder Klaytn from providing quick transaction finality and stable network.
* **Inefficient resource allocation due to difficulty in rational price determination** : Gas price should neither be too high or too low. A too low gas price increases vulnerability to DoS (denial-of-service) attacks and transaction delay for users. When it’s too high, the transaction cost is going to prevent users from using the network unreservedly. With the current fixed gas price policy, however, it is difficult to determine which price is appropriate, since the congestion status of the Klaytn network is constantly changing.
* **Inability to respond quickly and flexibly** : Gas price needs to go up during transaction spikes and go down when the network is not congested. But under the current fixed gas price scheme, it is not easy to analyze and change the gas price based on the network congestion situation.

A burn mechanism is needed to be introduced on Klaytn while solving the above problems, in order to link the growth of the ecosystem with KLAY value.

(This proposal only deals with dynamic fee policy, and a FIFO (First In First Out) transaction priority algorithm is already implemented. See https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn/pull/1282 and https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn/pull/1309)

## Specification
This specification derived heavily from Ethereum's [ERC-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md) written by Vitalik Buterin (@vbuterin), Eric Conner (@econoar), Rick Dudley (@AFDudley), Matthew Slipper (@mslipper), Ian Norden (@i-norden), and Abdelhamid Bakhta (@abdelhamidbakhta).

Transactions under a dynamic gas fee policy consist of `base_fee_per_gas`, which are dynamically controlled according to the network congestion status. Network congestion is measured by `gas_used` which is the gas usage by blocks created on Klaytn. `base_fee_per_gas` changes every block.

When a consensus node creates a block, if the `gas_used` of the parent block exceeds `gas_target`, `base_fee_per_gas` would go up. On the other hand, if the `gas_used` is lower than `gas_target`, the `base_fee_per_gas` would be reduced. This process would be repeated until the `base_fee_per_gas` doesn’t exceed `lower_bound` or `upper_bound`. The block proposer would receive a part of the fee of transactions included in the block, and the rest would be burned.

The below shows pseudo code of this proposal.

## Expected Effect

The proposed dynamic gas price mechanism is expected to solve the following problems.
* Reduce transaction process delay and storage overcapacity
* Flexible gas price control depending on the network status
* Introduction of a burn mechanism

But it may give rise to the following changes:
* Edit gas price-related code of the ecosystem wallet and other tools
* Lower predictability of gas price

## Backwards Compatibility

* All previous transaction types will remain the same.
* Setting fixed gas price to send transactions will still work and be included in blocks, but those transactions will be not included in the block if a `base_fee_per_gas` is higher than the gas price.
